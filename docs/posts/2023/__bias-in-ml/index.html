However, like any powerful tool, they come with challenges that need to be expertly managed. One of these challenges is the risk of bias in AI models, a subtle but pervasive issue that can undermine not only the performance of an AI system but the reputation and ethical standing of a business.\nBias in ML models can manifest in many forms, ranging from data collection to algorithm selection, and even the way results are interpreted. For businesses seeking to leverage AI, understanding, and mitigating these biases is not merely an ethical responsibility; it’s a strategic imperative.\nMachine learning models and generative AI applications can be affected by various forms of bias, stemming from both the data they are trained on and the way the models are designed and used. Here’s an overview:\nSorting biases by their risk or potential damage can be subjective and context dependent. What might be most damaging in one situation may not be in another. However, I can attempt to provide a general ordering based on a common understanding of potential impacts:\nSocietal and Ethical Bias: This can lead to serious consequences by reinforcing existing inequalities and biases in society. It can result in systemic discrimination, impacting large sections of the population.\nModels might be biased due to the broader societal and ethical beliefs, norms, or regulations at the time of their creation.\nExample A predictive policing algorithm that is trained on historical crime data may reinforce societal biases, such as racial or socio-economic biases present in the data. By allocating more police resources to areas with historically higher crime rates, the system may disproportionately target minority or disadvantaged communities, reflecting broader societal and ethical biases.\nCounter Measurement Consider societal and ethical implications during design and deployment, engage with diverse stakeholders, and possibly utilize third-party audits to ensure fairness and alignment with social values.\nFeedback Loop Bias This type of bias can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in a self-reinforcing manner, leading to the entrenchment of biased decisions and potentially widening societal inequalities. In interactive systems, biased predictions can lead to biased actions, which then lead to more biased data, and so on, in a feedback loop.\nExample An algorithm used to filter job applications may initially have a slight bias against candidates from a particular background. As the algorithm continues to influence hiring decisions, fewer individuals from that background are hired. This leads to even more biased training data over time, reinforcing and amplifying the initial bias in a continuous feedback loop.\nCounter measurement Regularly update the model with fresh, unbiased data and monitor its behavior over time to detect and correct any emerging biases.\nPrejudice Bias As part of data bias, this can result in highly unfair and discriminatory models that reflect and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It can affect individuals’ rights and opportunities. When data is collected and labeled based on prejudiced human beliefs, it might incorporate human biases such as racism or sexism.\nExample If a facial recognition system is trained primarily on images of light-skinned individuals and lacks diversity in skin tones, it may perform poorly on recognizing individuals with darker skin tones. This can result in racial bias, where the model’s performance is uneven across different racial groups, reflecting a prejudiced data collection process.\nCounter Measurement Prejudice Bias: Actively seek out and include diverse data points and consider ethical implications during data collection and preprocessing to avoid encoding prejudiced human beliefs.\nHistorical Bias This also can perpetuate societal inequalities if historical human biases are reflected in AI decisions. It can lead to the continuation of past injustices.\nIf the data includes societal or cultural biases, the model may learn these biases as well.\nExample If you’re building a hiring algorithm using data from a company that has historically favored hiring men for certain roles, the model may learn this bias and favor male candidates in its predictions, even if gender is not explicitly used as a feature.\nCounter measurement Historical Bias: Understand the historical context and societal biases that might be reflected in the data. If possible, adjust or re-weight the data to minimize these biases, and include features that capture potentially confounding variables. Deployment Bias Applying a model to a population or context different from its training data might cause substantial harm, especially if it leads to systematic misjudgment in critical areas like healthcare, finance, or legal decisions. Once in production, the model might be applied in contexts or to populations that it was not trained on, leading to biases in its predictions.\nExample A credit scoring model trained on data from a particular country or demographic group might be deployed in a different region with a different economic context. The model may perform poorly or unfairly in the new context because it was not trained on data representative of the population it’s being applied to.\nCounter Measurement Validate the model in the context where it will be deployed, using data that is representative of the target population or environment, and be prepared to make adjustments as needed.\nGroup Bias This can lead to discrimination against certain demographic groups, which can be damaging both to individuals within those groups and to social cohesion more broadly.\nSome models may have biased performance towards different demographic groups, leading to unfair treatments or outcomes.\nExample A facial recognition system might be trained on a dataset primarily composed of people from one ethnic group. As a result, the system may perform well for that group but poorly for others, leading to biased performance across different demographic groups.\nCounter measurement Implement fairness-aware machine learning techniques that account for demographic or group-based differences and validate the model across different groups to ensure equitable performance.\nSampling Bias This type of data bias can lead to models that systematically misrepresent reality, which might lead to flawed decisions with varying degrees of risk depending on the application.\nIf the training data isn’t representative of the population, the model will have a biased understanding.\nExample Suppose you’re building a voice recognition system and collect voice samples only from young adults in the United States. The model might perform poorly on accents from other regions or age groups because those voices were not represented in the training data.\nCounter Measurement Ensure that the data collection process represents the population accurately by including diverse and representative samples. Stratified sampling can help in achieving this balance.\nMeasurement Bias If measurements are consistently erroneous, the subsequent decisions can be highly flawed, leading to misleading insights and possibly risky actions.\nErrors in measuring variables or attributes can introduce biases into the data and, consequently, the trained model\nExample You are creating a health prediction model using data collected from various sensors, like heart rate monitors. If one type of sensor is consistently inaccurate or calibrated differently from others, the data will have systematic errors. The model trained on this data might then have biases in predictions, favoring or penalizing readings from that specific sensor type.\nCounter Measurement Ensure that the measurement tools and processes are validated, calibrated, and standardized. Test them across various scenarios to verify their accuracy.\nConfirmation Bias If a model is continuously fine-tuned on predictions that it makes, it may amplify its own biases.\nExample Imagine training a stock market prediction model. If you continually fine-tune the model based on its own predictions, rather than independent, fresh data, the model might become overly confident in its predictions and reinforce its own errors or biases. This creates a situation where the model is essentially confirming its own predictions, leading to a possible decrease in predictive accuracy.\nCounter Measurement Encourage practices that foster unbiased evaluation, such as cross-validation with diverse datasets, and promoting a culture of challenging assumptions within the team.\nLabeling Bias Incorrect or inconsistent labels can lead to a model misunderstanding the relationships in the data, possibly leading to wrong predictions with varying levels of damage depending on the context.\nMislabeling or inconsistent labeling of the data might skew the model’s understanding.\nExample Consider a sentiment analysis model trained on data where reviewers labeled sarcasm as positive sentiment. If the labeling doesn’t capture the true sentiment behind sarcastic comments, the model might interpret all sarcastic remarks as positive, leading to incorrect predictions.\nCounter Measurement Implement rigorous quality control and standardization processes for labeling, and consider having multiple human annotators provide labels to reduce inconsistencies.\nClass Imbalance While it can lead to poor performance on minority classes, its damage might be more confined compared to more pervasive biases, depending on the application.\nIf some classes are underrepresented in the training data, the model may perform poorly on those classes.\nExample In a medical diagnosis model, if a rare disease is underrepresented in the training data (e.g., only 5 out of 1000 examples), the model may learn to mostly predict the more common classes, leading to poor performance in detecting that rare disease.\nCounter Measurement Utilize techniques like oversampling minority classes, under-sampling majority classes, or employing specialized algorithms designed to handle class imbalance.\nSelection Bias (Algorithm Bias) Although it can skew the model towards particular features, the degree of risk might be more context-specific and potentially less harmful compared to biases that directly perpetuate discrimination.\nIf certain features are given undue importance during feature selection, it might bias the predictions.\nExample Suppose you are developing a recommendation system for movies. If you only select features related to a specific genre, such as action movies (e.g., explosions, fight scenes), the model might become biased towards recommending action movies and ignore other potentially relevant movies in different genres. This reflects a bias in the feature selection process, as you have given undue importance to certain characteristics.\nCounter Measurement Utilize feature selection methods that rely on objective criteria and validate the model with independent data sets to ensure that the selection is not inadvertently biased.\nObserver Bias This can distort the understanding of a model but might be considered less harmful as it primarily affects interpretation rather than the model’s functioning itself. The influence of the researchers’ expectations on the data collection, labeling, or interpretation can introduce bias.\nExample Consider a project where human experts are labeling images for a facial expression recognition system. If the labelers have preconceived notions about what certain expressions look like on people from different cultural backgrounds, their labels might reflect these biases. The model trained on this data will then learn these observer biases, potentially leading to uneven performance across different cultural groups.\nCounter Measurement Encourage multiple interpretations from different stakeholders or team members, fostering a culture that values diverse perspectives and critical evaluation.\nConfirmation Bias in Interpretation This bias affects how results are interpreted but may not affect the model’s operation directly, limiting its potential damage.\nHumans might interpret the results of a model in ways that confirm their existing beliefs or expectations, leading to biased conclusions.\nExample A data scientist has a hypothesis that a certain feature, such as user activity level, is the most important factor in predicting user engagement. When interpreting the results, they may focus on evidence that confirms this belief, overlooking other factors that could be equally or more important. This selective attention to the results that confirm their pre-existing belief leads to a biased interpretation of the model’s behavior.\nCounter Measurement Actively seek out and consider evidence that contradicts initial interpretations or hypotheses, and involve different stakeholders with varying perspectives in the interpretation process.\nExperimenter Bias While this can distort the research process, its impact might be limited to specific studies or experiments rather than having broad societal implications.\nThis might happen when researchers unintentionally influence the results of a study to reach a predetermined conclusion.\nExample A researcher developing an algorithm for a specific medical diagnosis might unconsciously prefer a particular modeling technique. This preference might lead them to design experiments in a way that makes this technique appear more effective than others, even if that’s not objectively the case.\nCounter Measurement Employ rigorous experimental design principles, possibly utilizing double-blind procedures or other methods to minimize the influence of individual researchers’ preferences or expectations.\nEvaluation Bias Though it can lead to incorrect conclusions about a model’s performance, it may not directly cause harm to individuals or society but rather affects the understanding of the model’s capability.\nIf the evaluation metrics or test data are biased, they might lead to misleading conclusions about the model’s performance.\nExample If a speech recognition model is evaluated only on a specific accent or dialect, the evaluation might indicate high performance. However, this evaluation is biased if the model is intended to be used by speakers of various accents and dialects, as it doesn’t truly reflect the model’s ability to handle diverse inputs.\nCounter Measurement Use diverse and representative datasets for evaluation and consider employing multiple evaluation metrics that capture different aspects of performance.\nAnchoring Bias: Typically considered a cognitive bias, its effects may be relatively minor in comparison to others, affecting decision-making processes rather than leading to systematic errors or discrimination.\nRelying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions during model development.\nExample A team is developing a recommendation algorithm and initially focuses on user click behavior as the primary feature. Throughout the development process, they may become anchored to this feature, giving it undue importance and overlooking other potentially valuable information. Even when presented with new data or insights, they may have difficulty adjusting their approach due to this initial anchoring.\nCounter Measurement Foster a culture that encourages reevaluation and reconsideration of initial decisions or hypotheses, and promote collaboration and diverse perspectives to avoid undue focus on early assumptions.\nBy employing these countermeasures, organizations can mitigate biases at various stages of the machine learning process, improving the fairness, robustness, and generalizability of their models.\nSummary Addressing biases in AI and ML is a complex, multifaceted task that demands a concerted effort across various stages of model development, deployment, and monitoring. In the rapidly evolving world of business, where AI-driven decisions are becoming more commonplace, understanding the nature of these biases, and implementing strategies to mitigate them is crucial.\nThe countermeasures include ensuring diversity in data, validating models in real-world contexts, employing fairness-aware machine learning techniques, and fostering a culture of critical evaluation and continuous learning. By doing so, businesses can build more robust, fair, and effective AI systems, aligning technology with core values and strategic goals. Navigating the challenges of bias in machine learning is not just about avoiding pitfalls; it’s about unlocking the full potential of AI. In a business world driven by data and powered by intelligent algorithms, a proactive approach to bias can lead to more informed decisions, enhanced trust with customers, and a competitive edge in the marketplace.\n","wordCount":"2489","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.virture.de/posts/2023/__bias-in-ml/images/img16.png","datePublished":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.virture.de/posts/2023/__bias-in-ml/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"virture.de - just a blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.virture.de/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.virture.de accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.virture.de/images/robot.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/posts title=blog><span>blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/archives title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/imprint/ title=imprint><span>imprint</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.virture.de>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.virture.de/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Bias in Machine Learning</h1><div class=post-description>Unlocking Fairness in AI: Navigating the Challenges of Bias in Machine Learning</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 5, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2489 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://www.virture.de/images/img16.png alt></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction:</a><ul><li><a href=#societal-and-ethical-bias>Societal and Ethical Bias:</a></li><li><a href=#feedback-loop-bias>Feedback Loop Bias</a></li><li><a href=#prejudice-bias>Prejudice Bias</a></li><li><a href=#historical-bias>Historical Bias</a></li><li><a href=#deployment-bias>Deployment Bias</a></li><li><a href=#group-bias>Group Bias</a></li><li><a href=#sampling-bias>Sampling Bias</a></li><li><a href=#measurement-bias>Measurement Bias</a></li><li><a href=#confirmation-bias>Confirmation Bias</a></li><li><a href=#labeling-bias>Labeling Bias</a></li><li><a href=#class-imbalance>Class Imbalance</a></li><li><a href=#selection-bias-algorithm-bias>Selection Bias (Algorithm Bias)</a></li><li><a href=#observer-bias>Observer Bias</a></li><li><a href=#confirmation-bias-in-interpretation>Confirmation Bias in Interpretation</a></li><li><a href=#experimenter-bias>Experimenter Bias</a></li><li><a href=#evaluation-bias>Evaluation Bias</a></li><li><a href=#anchoring-bias>Anchoring Bias:</a></li><li><a href=#summary>Summary</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=unlocking-fairness-in-ai-navigating-the-challenges-of-bias-in-machine-learning>Unlocking Fairness in AI: Navigating the Challenges of Bias in Machine Learning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unlocking-fairness-in-ai-navigating-the-challenges-of-bias-in-machine-learning>#</a></h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In the competitive landscape of modern business, AI and Machine Learning (ML) are no longer optional; they are essential tools driving innovation, efficiency, and growth.

If the labeling doesn&rsquo;t capture the true sentiment behind sarcastic comments, the model might interpret all sarcastic remarks as positive, leading to incorrect predictions.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-9>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-9>#</a></h4><p>Implement rigorous quality control and standardization processes for labeling, and consider having multiple human annotators provide labels to reduce inconsistencies.</p><hr><h3 id=class-imbalance>Class Imbalance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#class-imbalance>#</a></h3><p>While it can lead to poor performance on minority classes, its damage might be more confined compared to more pervasive biases, depending on the application.</p><p>If some classes are underrepresented in the training data, the model may perform poorly on those classes.</p><h4 id=example-10>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-10>#</a></h4><p>In a medical diagnosis model, if a rare disease is underrepresented in the training data (e.g., only 5 out of 1000 examples), the model may learn to mostly predict the more common classes, leading to poor performance in detecting that rare disease.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-10>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-10>#</a></h4><p>Utilize techniques like oversampling minority classes, under-sampling majority classes, or employing specialized algorithms designed to handle class imbalance.</p><hr><h3 id=selection-bias-algorithm-bias>Selection Bias (Algorithm Bias)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#selection-bias-algorithm-bias>#</a></h3><p>Although it can skew the model towards particular features, the degree of risk might be more context-specific and potentially less harmful compared to biases that directly perpetuate discrimination.</p><p>If certain features are given undue importance during feature selection, it might bias the predictions.</p><h4 id=example-11>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-11>#</a></h4><p>Suppose you are developing a recommendation system for movies. If you only select features related to a specific genre, such as action movies (e.g., explosions, fight scenes), the model might become biased towards recommending action movies and ignore other potentially relevant movies in different genres. This reflects a bias in the feature selection process, as you have given undue importance to certain characteristics.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-11>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-11>#</a></h4><p>Utilize feature selection methods that rely on objective criteria and validate the model with independent data sets to ensure that the selection is not inadvertently biased.</p><hr><h3 id=observer-bias>Observer Bias<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#observer-bias>#</a></h3><p>This can distort the understanding of a model but might be considered less harmful as it primarily affects interpretation rather than the model&rsquo;s functioning itself.
The influence of the researchers&rsquo; expectations on the data collection, labeling, or interpretation can introduce bias.</p><h4 id=example-12>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-12>#</a></h4><p>Consider a project where human experts are labeling images for a facial expression recognition system. If the labelers have preconceived notions about what certain expressions look like on people from different cultural backgrounds, their labels might reflect these biases. The model trained on this data will then learn these observer biases, potentially leading to uneven performance across different cultural groups.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-12>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-12>#</a></h4><p>Encourage multiple interpretations from different stakeholders or team members, fostering a culture that values diverse perspectives and critical evaluation.</p><hr><h3 id=confirmation-bias-in-interpretation>Confirmation Bias in Interpretation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#confirmation-bias-in-interpretation>#</a></h3><p>This bias affects how results are interpreted but may not affect the model&rsquo;s operation directly, limiting its potential damage.</p><p>Humans might interpret the results of a model in ways that confirm their existing beliefs or expectations, leading to biased conclusions.</p><h4 id=example-13>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-13>#</a></h4><p>A data scientist has a hypothesis that a certain feature, such as user activity level, is the most important factor in predicting user engagement. When interpreting the results, they may focus on evidence that confirms this belief, overlooking other factors that could be equally or more important. This selective attention to the results that confirm their pre-existing belief leads to a biased interpretation of the model&rsquo;s behavior.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-13>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-13>#</a></h4><p>Actively seek out and consider evidence that contradicts initial interpretations or hypotheses, and involve different stakeholders with varying perspectives in the interpretation process.</p><hr><h3 id=experimenter-bias>Experimenter Bias<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#experimenter-bias>#</a></h3><p>While this can distort the research process, its impact might be limited to specific studies or experiments rather than having broad societal implications.</p><p>This might happen when researchers unintentionally influence the results of a study to reach a predetermined conclusion.</p><h4 id=example-14>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-14>#</a></h4><p>A researcher developing an algorithm for a specific medical diagnosis might unconsciously prefer a particular modeling technique. This preference might lead them to design experiments in a way that makes this technique appear more effective than others, even if that&rsquo;s not objectively the case.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-14>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-14>#</a></h4><p>Employ rigorous experimental design principles, possibly utilizing double-blind procedures or other methods to minimize the influence of individual researchers&rsquo; preferences or expectations.</p><hr><h3 id=evaluation-bias>Evaluation Bias<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#evaluation-bias>#</a></h3><p>Though it can lead to incorrect conclusions about a model&rsquo;s performance, it may not directly cause harm to individuals or society but rather affects the understanding of the model&rsquo;s capability.</p><p>If the evaluation metrics or test data are biased, they might lead to misleading conclusions about the model&rsquo;s performance.</p><h4 id=example-15>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-15>#</a></h4><p>If a speech recognition model is evaluated only on a specific accent or dialect, the evaluation might indicate high performance. However, this evaluation is biased if the model is intended to be used by speakers of various accents and dialects, as it doesn&rsquo;t truly reflect the model&rsquo;s ability to handle diverse inputs.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-15>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-15>#</a></h4><p>Use diverse and representative datasets for evaluation and consider employing multiple evaluation metrics that capture different aspects of performance.</p><hr><h3 id=anchoring-bias>Anchoring Bias:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#anchoring-bias>#</a></h3><p>Typically considered a cognitive bias, its effects may be relatively minor in comparison to others, affecting decision-making processes rather than leading to systematic errors or discrimination.</p><p>Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions during model development.</p><h4 id=example-16>Example<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-16>#</a></h4><p>A team is developing a recommendation algorithm and initially focuses on user click behavior as the primary feature. Throughout the development process, they may become anchored to this feature, giving it undue importance and overlooking other potentially valuable information. Even when presented with new data or insights, they may have difficulty adjusting their approach due to this initial anchoring.</p><h4 id=counter-measurement-16>Counter Measurement<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#counter-measurement-16>#</a></h4><p>Foster a culture that encourages reevaluation and reconsideration of initial decisions or hypotheses, and promote collaboration and diverse perspectives to avoid undue focus on early assumptions.</p><hr><p>By employing these countermeasures, organizations can mitigate biases at various stages of the machine learning process, improving the fairness, robustness, and generalizability of their models.</p><h3 id=summary>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h3><p>Addressing biases in AI and ML is a complex, multifaceted task that demands a concerted effort across various stages of model development, deployment, and monitoring. In the rapidly evolving world of business, where AI-driven decisions are becoming more commonplace, understanding the nature of these biases, and implementing strategies to mitigate them is crucial.</p><p>The countermeasures include ensuring diversity in data, validating models in real-world contexts, employing fairness-aware machine learning techniques, and fostering a culture of critical evaluation and continuous learning. By doing so, businesses can build more robust, fair, and effective AI systems, aligning technology with core values and strategic goals.
Navigating the challenges of bias in machine learning is not just about avoiding pitfalls; it&rsquo;s about unlocking the full potential of AI. In a business world driven by data and powered by intelligent algorithms, a proactive approach to bias can lead to more informed decisions, enhanced trust with customers, and a competitive edge in the marketplace.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://www.virture.de/tags/machine-learning/>machine learning</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://www.virture.de/posts/2023/hyperparameter-tuning/><span class=title>Next »</span><br><span>Hyperparameter Tuning</span></a></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2023 <a href=https://www.virture.de>virture.de - just a blog</a></span>
